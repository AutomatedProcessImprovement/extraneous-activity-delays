class Configuration:
    """
    Class storing the configuration parameters for the extraneous activity delay optimizer.

    Extraneous delays options:
        discovery_method            Method to discover the extraneous delays of each activity instance. Naive: the extraneous delay of an
                                    activity instance corresponds to the interval since the last time the activity was enabled & the
                                    resource available, and the activity start time. Complex: the extraneous delay of an activity instance
                                    corresponds to the interval since the first time the activity was enabled & the resource available,
                                    until the last time this happened.
        timer_placement             Option to consider the placement of the timers either BEFORE (the extraneous delay is considered to be
                                    happening previously to an activity instance) or AFTER (the extraneous delay is considered to be
                                    happening after an activity instance) each activity.
        simulation_engine           Simulation engine to use during the optimization process (e.g. Prosimos).
        optimization_metric         Metric to optimize during the optimization process.

    Extraneous delays parameters:
        should_consider_timer       Function taking as input a list of seconds for all the delays that activity has registered, and
                                    returning a bool indicating if those delays should be considered as a timer, or discarded as outliers.
        time_gap                    For complex extraneous delays, maximum interval of time allowed from a work item (task of off-duty
                                    interval) to another work item to not consider that the resource was available in that interval. For
                                    example, a resource works in a task from 16.00 to 17.49, but their off-duty period starts at 18.49. If
                                    time-gap is set to >11 minutes, it won't be counted as an available period.
        extrapolate                 If 'True', when computing the first and last available times (complex delays), instead of computing
                                    the first available time as such, move it to half its distance between itself and the enablement of
                                    the activity instance. For example, if the enablement is at 1, and the discovered first available time
                                    is at 5, the first available time is corrected to 3 (the middle point). The same is done for the last
                                    available and the start of the activity instance. The objective is to reduce potential mis-estimations
                                    as the real first and last available times are unknown, but within those two intervals.

    Optimization process parameters:
        num_iterations              Number of iterations of the hyper-optimization search.
        num_evaluation_simulations  Number of simulations performed with each enhanced BPMN model to evaluate its quality.
        max_alpha                   Maximum scale factor to multiply the discovered timers in the hyper-optimization.
        training_partition_ratio    Float value between 0.0 and 1.0 (or None). If None, train and validate the hyper-parametrization using
                                    the full event log passed as argument. Otherwise, perform the hyper-parametrization with a hold-out
                                    retaining this percentage of events (in full traces) for the training set. For example, if the value is
                                    0.8 it will train with approximately a subset of traces of the event log with the 80% of the total
                                    events, and validate with the remaining traces.

    Enabled time estimation:
        concurrency_thresholds      Thresholds for the concurrency oracle (heuristics or overlapping).
        working_schedules           Dictionary with the resources as key and the working calendars (RCalendar) as value.

    General parameters:
        process_name                Name of the process to use in the output files (BPMN and simulated log files).
        log_ids                     Identifiers for each key element (e.g. executed activity or resource).
        debug                       Boolean denoting whether to print debug information or not.
        clean_intermediate_files    Boolean denoting whether to remove the folders of the non-best solutions or not.
